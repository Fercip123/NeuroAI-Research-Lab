## Data Setup

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the raw dataset (`emotions.csv`) is not included in this repository. To run the analysis, please follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [EEG Brainwave Dataset: Feeling Emotions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Rename the CSV file to `emotions.csv` (if it has a different name).
4. Place the file in the same directory as the `emotions.py` script.
