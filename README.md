# NeuroAI-Research-Lab 

This repository is dedicated to the exploration, experimentation, and research at the intersection of **Neuroscience** and **Artificial Intelligence** (NeuroAI). The primary focus of this lab is to decode neural signals (EEG/fMRI) into machine-understandable information.

---

## Future Research Goals
- Implementation of **Deep Learning** architectures (LSTM/CNN) for raw time-series EEG data.
- Exploring **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** for real-time robotic control.
